/**
 * @brief Log levels for embedded high-performance logging system.
 *
 * Each module should specify a log level by setting @ref LOGGING_TOP_LOG_LEVEL.
 * All log messages with a level at or below the specified level will be printed
 * for that module with zero runtime overhead.
 *
 * Log levels in order of severity (lowest to highest):
 * - #LOG_NONE - Completely disable all logging
 * - #LOG_ERROR - Critical failures requiring immediate attention  
 * - #LOG_WARN - Abnormal conditions that don't stop execution
 * - #LOG_INFO - Normal operational status messages
 * - #LOG_DEBUG - Detailed diagnostic information for development
 *
 * @note Higher log levels generate more output and impact performance.
 *       For production embedded systems, use LOG_WARN or LOG_ERROR only.

 * @brief Disable all logging completely.

 * When LOGGING_TOP_LOG_LEVEL is LOG_NONE, all logging macros become empty

 * - Configuration issues with fallbacks
